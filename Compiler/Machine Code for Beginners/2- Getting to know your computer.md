## What the chips do
Chips can be also called as a **microchip**, or **computer chip**. Is a small electronic device made up of multiple interconnected electronic components such as [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor"), [resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor"), and [capacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor "Capacitor").

Messages flow between the chips in the form of bytes. It happens by [computer bus](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bus). Its role is to transfer data, signals or power between some of the components that make up a computer. The *address bus* carries memory address. There are three separte systems of tracks for carrying bytes for doing different jobs. Each system of tracks is called a bus. The *data bus* carries bytes of instructions or information.

ROM stands for "read only memory". The machine code instructions which tell the computer what to do are stored in the ROM chips. On older computers, is here where are stored the interpreter to translate BASIC into computer code, for example. On modern computers, it was moved to small flash chips. More details could be found in [EEPROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM).

### The RAM chips
RAM stands for "random access memory". This is where the programs you give the computer are stored while the computer is working on them. The computer can find or access any piece of information anywhere in the memory. And when switch the computer off, the information stored in RAM is wiped out.

### Clock
Clock is a quartz crystal which pulses millions of times a second and regulates the flow of pulses inside the computer.

### The microprocessor (CPU)
This is where all the computer's work is done. Calculations, compares pieces of data, makes decisions and co-ordinates all the other activities inside the computer. The information telling the CPU what to do is in the ROM (or small flash chips, for modern computers).
